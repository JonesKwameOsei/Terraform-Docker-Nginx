# Provisioning an Nginx server with Terraform
## Overview of Project
This exercise is to utilise **terraform** to provision an **nginx server**. Nginx server can be provisioned on Mac, Windows, or Linux. For this exercise, we will provision the nginx server on Windows. <p>
### Pre-requisite 
Running this exercise on Windows 11, Mac, or Linux is a straightforward approach. However, running this on Windows 10 machine is not. One needs to use the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) before.
